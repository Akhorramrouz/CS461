    "## Part 1: Why Do We Need Attention?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before transformers, we used **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** for sequence tasks. But RNNs had problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sequential Processing**: RNNs process words one at a time, making them slow\n",
    "2. **Memory Issues**: They forget information from earlier in long sequences\n",
    "3. **No Parallelization**: Can't process multiple words simultaneously\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attention** solves these problems by letting the model look at ALL words at once and decide which ones are important!\n",

    "\n",
    "Consider this sentence: \"The animal didn't cross the street because **it** was too tired.\"\n",

    "When you read \"it\", your brain automatically knows it refers to \"animal\" (not \"street\"). You **attend** to the relevant word. That's what attention mechanisms do!"

    "## Part 9: Key Takeaways & Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Attention Mechanism**\n",
    "   - Allows model to focus on relevant parts of input\n",
    "   - Uses Query, Key, Value paradigm\n",
    "   - Formula: Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T / √d_k)V\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Self-Attention**\n",
    "   - Each word attends to all words (including itself)\n",
    "   - Captures relationships between words\n",
    "   - Parallel processing (unlike RNNs)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multi-Head Attention**\n",
    "   - Multiple attention mechanisms in parallel\n",
    "   - Each head learns different relationships\n",
    "   - More expressive than single attention\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Transformer Block**\n",
    "   - Multi-head attention + Feed-forward network\n",
    "   - Residual connections + Layer normalization\n",
    "   - Stack multiple blocks for deeper models\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Positional Encoding**\n",
    "   - Adds word order information\n",
    "   - Sine/cosine functions at different frequencies\n",
    "   - Added to input embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Transformers Are Powerful:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Parallelization**: Process all words simultaneously\n",
    "✅ **Long-range dependencies**: Can attend to any word regardless of distance\n",
    "✅ **Flexibility**: Same architecture for many tasks (translation, generation, etc.)\n",
    "✅ **Scalability**: Can be trained on massive datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Study encoder-decoder architecture (for translation)\n",
    "2. Learn about different transformer variants (BERT, GPT, T5)\n",
    "3. Understand training techniques (learning rate schedules, warmup)\n",
    "4. Explore applications (NLP, vision transformers, protein folding)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended Resources:\n",
