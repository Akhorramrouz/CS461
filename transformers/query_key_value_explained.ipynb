    "- **Key (K)**: \"What information do I contain that others might search for?\"\n",

    "\n",
    "Imagine you're in a library searching for information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Scenario\n",
    "You walk into a library and ask: **\"I need information about machine learning\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how Q, K, V work:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Concept | Library Analogy | What It Does |\n",
    "|---------|----------------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Query** | Your search request: \"machine learning\" | Represents what you're looking for |\n",
    "| **Key** | Book titles/labels on shelves: \"AI Textbook\", \"Neural Networks Guide\", \"Cooking Recipes\" | Help you find relevant books |\n",
    "| **Value** | Actual book contents | The information you actually take away |\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **You have a Query**: \"machine learning\"\n",
    "2. **You check Keys** (book titles): \n",
    "   - \"AI Textbook\" ✅ (relevant! high match)\n",
    "   - \"Neural Networks Guide\" ✅ (relevant! high match)\n",
    "   - \"Cooking Recipes\" ❌ (not relevant, low match)\n",
    "3. **You read the Values** (contents) from books with high matches\n",
    "4. **You combine** the information proportionally:\n",
    "   - 50% from \"AI Textbook\"\n",
    "   - 50% from \"Neural Networks Guide\"\n",
    "   - 0% from \"Cooking Recipes\"\n",

    "This is even more intuitive!\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "You type: \"best pizza in New York\"  ← This is your QUERY\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Query (Q)**: Your search term: \"best pizza in New York\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Keys (K)**: Metadata/tags of each webpage:\n",
    "   - Page 1: [\"pizza\", \"New York\", \"restaurant\", \"food\"] ✅\n",
    "   - Page 2: [\"pizza\", \"Chicago\", \"deep dish\"] ⚠️\n",
    "   - Page 3: [\"cars\", \"vehicles\", \"New York\"] ❌\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Matching**: Google compares your Query against Keys:\n",
    "   - Page 1: High relevance (0.9) - has \"pizza\" AND \"New York\"\n",
    "   - Page 2: Medium relevance (0.3) - has \"pizza\" but wrong city\n",
    "   - Page 3: Low relevance (0.1) - only has \"New York\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Values (V)**: Actual content of webpages\n",
    "   - Page 1 Value: \"Joe's Pizza on 42nd Street has amazing slices...\"\n",
    "   - Page 2 Value: \"Chicago deep dish is characterized by...\"\n",
    "   - Page 3 Value: \"The best cars to drive in New York are...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Final Result**: Google shows you a **weighted combination**:\n",
    "   - 90% of what you see comes from Page 1 (high relevance)\n",
    "   - 9% from Page 2 (medium relevance)\n",
    "   - 1% from Page 3 (low relevance)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Magic\n",
    "You don't search the actual content (Values) directly - that would be too slow! Instead:\n",
    "- Keys are like **quick summaries** for fast matching\n",
    "- Values are the **full content** you actually want\n",
    "- Query is **what you're looking for**"

    "## 🧩 The Final Puzzle: Why Three Separate Transformations?\n",
    "\n",
    "You might ask: **\"Why can't we just use the original embeddings? Why transform them into Q, K, V?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "Great question! Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Without Q, K, V (using just embeddings):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# If we just did: embedding('sat') • embedding('cat')\n",
    "# This would measure general similarity\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Words that are similar in meaning might not need to attend to each other!\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \"happy\" and \"joyful\" are similar, but when understanding a sentence, \"happy\" might need to attend to the **subject** (who is happy?) rather than other emotion words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### With Q, K, V transformations:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# We do: Query('sat') • Key('cat')\n",
    "# This measures TASK-SPECIFIC relevance\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: The transformations learn to encode **relationships** rather than just similarity!\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Query transformation** learns: \"What relationships should I look for?\"\n",
    "- **Key transformation** learns: \"What relationships do I participate in?\"\n",
    "- **Value transformation** learns: \"What information should I contribute?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concrete Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence: \"The **cat** sat on the **mat**\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Query('sat')** learns to look for:\n",
    "  - Noun patterns (for subjects)\n",
    "  - Location patterns (for where)\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Key('cat')** learns to advertise:\n",
    "  - \"I'm a noun\"\n",
    "  - \"I can be a subject\"\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Value('cat')** provides:\n",
    "  - Rich semantic meaning: [animal, furry, pet, small, ...]"

    "\n",
    "### What Happens in Attention (Simple Version):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start**: You have word embeddings\n",
    "2. **Transform**: Create three views (Q, K, V) of each word\n",
    "3. **Compare**: Match Queries against Keys (\"What's relevant?\")\n",
    "4. **Combine**: Mix Values based on relevance weights\n",
    "5. **Result**: Each word now understands its context!\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Genius:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No fixed rules**: The model **learns** what to pay attention to\n",
    "- **Flexible**: Different attention heads can learn different types of relationships\n",
    "- **Parallel**: All words processed simultaneously (unlike RNNs)\n",
    "- **Contextual**: Each word's representation depends on surrounding words\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "🔍 **Query**: \"What should I look for?\"\n",
    "🔑 **Key**: \"What do I represent for others to find?\"\n",
    "💎 **Value**: \"What do I actually contribute?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Magic Formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right)V$$\n",
